title: About me
---
Hi, I'm Augusto. I live and work remotely in Honolulu, Hawaii, the most remote capital in the world.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Instructure](https://www.instructure.com). Throughout this site, my views are my own and not those of my employer.

After graduating from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) in 2001 with a B.S. in [Engineering &amp; Applied Science](http://eas.caltech.edu), I've spent the last sixteen years writing software for a variety of companies, including an early [complex event processing startup](http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/whatever-happened-to-ispheres/) and an [industry research and development firm](http://appliedminds.com).  I believe the key to good software is aligning design with [user intuition](http://www.baddesigns.com/examples.html).

You can see my full resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9bQnbowUCXQXmajGEt1Ulaz1PeJLlEZ01ZouH_4Xfo/edit?usp=sharing).

You can contact me either at my Twitter account below, or at hello[at]&lt;<i>this domain</i>&gt;.
